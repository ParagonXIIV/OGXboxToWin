A OGXBOX Kernel and Operating system running on windows pc hardware

# Update -> 3:19â€¯PM Wednesday, OCT 18, 2023 (EDT)


What is this:

    This is the Kernel and Operating system reversed engineered and running on modern windows based hardware.
    So, instead of windows you have a fully working xbox Kernel and Operating system running on windows based hardware
    with udated code and features for better looking xbox games. You can still use your CD Games or ISO'S of your own
    copies of bought games to run on this hardware.
